            To Whom It May Concern,

            I am writing to request authorization for Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) for my patient, {patient_name}, diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

            Physician's Information:
            Name: {physician_name}
            Phone: {physician_phone}
            Fax: {physician_fax}
            NPI: {physician_npi}
            Address: {physician_address}

            Patient's Information:
            Name: {patient_name}
            DOB: {patient_dob}

            Based on the patient's condition and having failed two or more lines of systemic therapy, we believe the patient meets all necessary criteria for Yescarta.

            Drug Criteria Requirements Met:
            - Patient has been diagnosed with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, including DLBCL, after two or more lines of systemic therapy.
            - Patient has a performance status that supports the feasibility of undergoing the CAR T-cell therapy treatment process.
            - Patient has adequate organ function as required for Yescarta therapy.
            - Patient has been informed of the potential benefits and risks of Yescarta therapy, including the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities, and wishes to proceed.

            Please consider this letter as a formal request for the prior authorization of Yescarta. Attached are all necessary medical records, including prior treatment history and documentation supporting this request.

            Thank you for your attention to this matter.

            Sincerely,

            {physician_name}

            Physician's Information:
            Name: {physician_name}
            Phone: {physician_phone}

            Patient's Information:
            Name: {patient_name}
            DOB: {patient_dob}

            A PET/CT scan is medically necessary to assess the extent of disease, evaluate treatment response, and guide further management in this patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Given the patient's history of relapsed or refractory DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy, accurate staging and assessment through PET/CT are critical to optimizing the treatment approach, including consideration for targeted therapies such as CAR T-cell therapy.

            Sincerely,
