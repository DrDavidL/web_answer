Here are some general steps for treating localized cellulitis:

1. **Oral Antibiotics**: For a healthy patient with localized cellulitis, oral antibiotics are usually the first line of treatment. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include cephalexin or dicloxacillin. If MRSA is suspected, doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used.

2. **Monitor the Patient**: It's important to monitor the patient's response to treatment. Improvement should be seen within a few days. If the cellulitis doesn't improve, the patient may need to be reevaluated and possibly switched to a different antibiotic.

3. **Supportive Care**: Encourage the patient to rest and elevate the affected area to help reduce swelling. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also be used to manage discomfort.

4. **Prevention**: Good skin hygiene can help prevent future episodes of cellulitis. This includes keeping the skin clean and moisturized, promptly treating any cuts or scrapes, and using a moisturizer to prevent skin cracking.

Remember, this is a general guideline and the treatment may vary based on the patient's specific condition and response to medication. Always consult with a healthcare professional for the most appropriate treatment."""

### Patient Information:
**Name:** John Doe  
**Age:** 30 years  
**Date of EEG:** [Date]  
**Referring Physician:** Dr. Jane Smith  
**Indication for EEG:** Evaluation of episodic confusion and suspected seizure activity.

### EEG Technique:
The EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. The recording included photic stimulation and hyperventilation. The total recording time was 60 minutes, including awake, drowsy, and sleep stages.

### Background Activity:
The background activity consists of a normal alpha rhythm at 8-10 Hz, predominant in the posterior regions and reactive to eye opening. Intermittent theta activity is observed in the temporal regions, which is normal for drowsiness and light sleep stages.

### Episodic Activity/Abnormalities:
- **Generalized Spike-and-Wave Discharges:** No generalized spike-and-wave discharges were observed.
- **Focal Abnormalities:** There were intermittent sharp waves and spikes noted in the left temporal lobe, more prominent during drowsiness. These findings suggest focal irritability.
- **Photic Stimulation:** No significant response to photic stimulation, indicating no photosensitivity.
- **Hyperventilation:** No significant changes were induced by hyperventilation.

### Impression:
This EEG demonstrates intermittent sharp waves and spikes in the left temporal region, which may be indicative of focal epileptogenic activity, particularly given the clinical context of episodic confusion. There are no signs of generalized seizure activity. The background rhythm is otherwise normal, with appropriate reactivity. These findings should be correlated with the clinical picture and, if necessary, further evaluated with additional diagnostic modalities such as an MRI of the brain or long-term video-EEG monitoring to better characterize the nature of the episodes and to guide treatment options.

### Recommendations:
- Consider correlation with clinical symptoms and history.
- MRI of the brain to exclude structural abnormalities contributing to focal epileptogenic activity.
- Consideration for long-term video-EEG monitoring for a more definitive characterization of episodic events and to guide management.

This impression is intended to provide an overview of the EEG findings and should be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's clinical history and other diagnostic studies.

2. **Tuberculosis (TB):** If the patient has been exposed to TB, this could explain his symptoms and the mass, particularly if the mass is a result of a Ghon complex or calcified granuloma.
3. **Pneumonia:** Although less likely given the duration of symptoms and presence of a mass, a complicated pneumonia could potentially appear as a mass on a chest X-ray.
4. **Pulmonary Abscess:** Similar to pneumonia, an abscess could potentially appear as a mass, though this is less likely without other signs of acute infection.
5. **Fungal Infection:** Certain fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis or aspergillosis, can mimic cancer on imaging and cause chronic respiratory symptoms, particularly in certain geographic areas or with certain exposures.


*Lower Probability:*
1. **Sarcoidosis:** This is less common, but can cause similar symptoms and imaging findings.
2. **Lung Adenoma or Pulmonary Hamartoma:** These benign tumors could theoretically cause a mass, but are less likely and typically don't cause symptoms unless they're large.
3. **Silicosis:** Given the patient's occupational exposure, this could be a consideration, but typically causes a more diffuse process rather than a single mass.

Having diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure, being overweight, and heart disease means you have to be careful about what you eat. Here's a simple guide:

**Eat more fruits and veggies**: They are good for you. Try to eat them at every meal.
**Choose whole grains**: Foods like brown rice and whole wheat bread are better than white rice and white bread.
**Go for lean meats**: Try chicken, turkey, or fish more often than red meat.
**Eat less salt**: This helps with your blood pressure. Be careful with packaged foods, they often have a lot of salt.
**Drink water**: Instead of sugary drinks like soda or fruit juice, drink water.
**Watch your portions**: Even if a food is good for you, eating too much can make you gain weight.
What should I avoid?

**Avoid sugary foods**: Foods like candy, cookies, soda, and fruit juice can make your blood sugar go up too much.
**Avoid fatty foods**: Foods like fast food, fried food, and fatty meats can make heart disease worse.
**Avoid salty foods**: Things like chips, canned soups, and fast food can make your blood pressure go up.
**Avoid alcohol**: It can cause problems with your blood sugar and blood pressure.
Remember, everyone is different. What works for someone else might not work for you. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian to get help with your diet."""

pt_ed_intermediate_example = """What should I eat?

Managing diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and heart disease involves careful consideration of your diet. Here are some recommendations:

**Increase fruit and vegetable intake**: These are high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, but low in calories. Aim to include a variety of colors in your meals to ensure you're getting a wide range of nutrients.
Choose whole grains over refined grains: Whole grains like brown rice, whole grain bread, and quinoa have more fiber and help control blood sugar levels better than refined grains like white bread and white rice.
Opt for lean proteins: Choose lean meats like chicken or turkey, and fish which is high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Limit red meat, as it can be high in unhealthy fats.
Limit sodium (salt) intake: High sodium can raise blood pressure. Aim for no more than 2300 mg per day. Beware of hidden sodium in processed and restaurant foods.
Stay hydrated with water: Choose water or unsweetened drinks over soda or fruit juices, which can be high in sugar.
Monitor portion sizes: Even healthy foods can lead to weight gain if eaten in large amounts. Use measuring cups or a food scale to ensure you're not overeating.
What should I avoid?

**Limit sugary foods and drinks**: These can cause your blood sugar to spike and can lead to weight gain. This includes sweets like candy, cookies, and sugary beverages.
**Limit saturated and trans fats**: These types of fats are found in fried foods, fast foods, and fatty cuts of meat, and can increase your risk of heart disease.
**Avoid high-sodium foods**: Foods like chips, canned soups, and some fast foods can be high in sodium, which can raise your blood pressure.
**Moderate alcohol intake**: Alcohol can affect your blood sugar and blood pressure. Limit to no more than one drink per day for women and two for men.

pt_ed_advanced_example = """What should I eat?

Managing conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, obesity, and coronary artery disease requires careful dietary planning. Here are some specific recommendations:

**Increase fruit and vegetable intake**: Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, with low energy density. Aim for at least 5 servings per day, including a variety of colors to ensure a broad spectrum of nutrients.
**Choose whole grains over refined grains**: Whole grains contain the entire grain â€” the bran, germ, and endosperm. Foods made from these grains are rich in fiber, which can slow the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream and prevent spikes in glucose 
and insulin. Opt for brown rice, oatmeal, whole grain bread, and quinoa.
**Opt for lean proteins and plant-based proteins**: Select lean meats like skinless chicken or turkey, and fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and mackerel. Plant-based proteins, such as lentils, beans, and tofu, can also be good sources of protein 
and are beneficial for kidney disease management.
**Limit sodium (salt) intake**: Excessive sodium can contribute to hypertension and exacerbate kidney disease by causing more protein to be excreted in the urine. Aim for less than 2300 mg per day and consider even lower targets as advised by your healthcare provider. 
Remember that processed and restaurant foods often contain high levels of hidden sodium.
**Hydrate with water and limit sugary drinks**: Water should be your primary beverage. Sugary drinks, including fruit juices, can significantly increase your daily sugar and calorie intake.
**Monitor portion sizes**: Use portion control to avoid overeating and manage weight. This is critical even with healthy foods, as excess calories can lead to weight gain and worsen insulin resistance.
What should I avoid?

**Limit foods high in added sugars**: High sugar foods and drinks can cause hyperglycemia and contribute to obesity. Be aware of foods with hidden sugars like low-fat snacks or processed foods.
**Limit saturated and trans fats**: These types of fats, found in fried foods, fast foods, and fatty cuts of meat, can increase LDL ("bad") cholesterol and decrease HDL ("good") cholesterol, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis.
**Avoid high-sodium foods**: Excessive sodium can exacerbate hypertension and kidney disease. High-sodium foods often include processed foods, fast foods, and certain canned or packaged foods.
**Moderate alcohol intake**: Excessive alcohol can lead to hypertension, and in diabetics, it can cause hypoglycemia. If you do drink, limit yourself to up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.
Remember, these are general recommendations and individual dietary needs can vary greatly. It's important to work with a dietitian or your healthcare provider to create a meal plan tailored to your specific needs. Regular physical activity, medication adherence, regular

```Patient Response:``` Oh doctor, I've been suffering from this severe headache for the past week, and it's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. The pain is just unbearable, pulsating through my head like a hammer. It's making me feel nauseous, and at times, I'm even sensitive to light and sound. I'm really worried because it's not just a regular headache; it feels like something is terribly wrong inside my head. I can barely sleep, and I'm scared it might be something serious. I need your help to make this stop.

```DDx:``` The differential diagnosis for severe headache is broad but can be narrowed down with more information. The described symptoms of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia suggest a possible migraine. However, the severity and acute onset could also point towards conditions like a subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially if there's a "thunderclap" quality to the headache onset. Other considerations include tension-type headache, cluster headache, or secondary causes like a mass lesion. Assessing risk factors, onset, and associated symptoms is crucial for further narrowing the differential diagnosis.

Mr. Smith is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presents to the clinic today with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain began approximately 2 days ago and has been intermittent in nature. He describes the pain as a "pressure-like" sensation located in the center of his chest. The pain does not radiate and is not associated with shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis.

He rates the pain as a 6/10 at its worst. He notes that the pain seems to be exacerbated by physical activity and relieved by rest. He has tried over-the-counter antacids with minimal relief. He denies any recent trauma to the chest or upper body. He has no known history of heart disease but his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62.

He has not experienced any fever, cough, or other symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection. He denies any recent travel or prolonged periods of immobility. He has not noticed any lower extremity swelling or discoloration.

He is a former smoker but quit 10 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. He is compliant with his antihypertensive medication and statin.

In summary, this is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presenting with 2 days of intermittent, pressure-like chest pain worsened by physical activity and partially relieved by rest.

- **Specific**: Descriptive but succinct (maximum of 5 words).
- **Novel**: Absent in the preceding summary.
- **Faithful**: Extracted from the context.
- **Location**: Can appear anywhere within the context.

**Guidelines**:
- Start with a general summary of the specified word count. It can be broad, using phrases like 'the context talks about'.
- Every word in the summary should impart meaningful information. Refine the prior summary for smoother flow and to integrate added entities.
- Maximize space by merging details, condensing information, and removing redundant phrases.
- Summaries should be compact, clear, and standalone, ensuring they can be understood without revisiting the context.
- You can position newly identified entities anywhere in the revised summary.
- Retain all entities from the prior summary. If space becomes an issue, introduce fewer new entities.
- Each summary iteration should maintain the designated word count.

Expert: Instructional Designer
Objective: To optimize the formatting of a multiple-choice question (MCQ) for clear display in a ChatGPT prompt.
Assumptions: You want the MCQ to be presented in a structured and readable manner for the ChatGPT model.

**Sample MCQ - Follow this format**:

**Question**:
What is the general structure of recommendations for treating Rheumatoid Arthritis according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)?

**Options**:
- **A.** Single algorithm with 3 treatment phases irrespective of disease duration
- **B.** Distinction between early (â‰¤6 months) and established RA with separate algorithm for each
- **C.** Treat-to-target strategy with aim at reducing disease activity by â‰¥50%
- **D.** Initial therapy with Methotrexate monotherapy with or without addition of glucocorticoids


The correct answer is **B. Distinction between early (â‰¤6 months) and established RA with separate algorithm for each**.

**Rationale**:

1. The ACR guidelines for RA treatment make a clear distinction between early RA (disease duration â‰¤6 months) and established RA (disease duration >6 months). The rationale behind this distinction is the recognition that early RA and established RA may have different prognostic implications and can respond differently to treatments. 
   
2. **A** is incorrect because while there are various treatment phases described by ACR, they don't universally follow a single algorithm irrespective of disease duration.

3. **C** may reflect an overarching goal in the management of many chronic diseases including RA, which is to reduce disease activity and improve the patient's quality of life. However, the specific quantification of "â‰¥50%" isn't a standard adopted universally by the ACR for RA.

4. **D** does describe an initial approach for many RA patients. Methotrexate is often the first-line drug of choice, and glucocorticoids can be added for additional relief, especially in the early phase of the disease to reduce inflammation. But, this option does not capture the overall structure of ACR's recommendations for RA.

image_gen_explanation = """Once these tools are accurate in their depictions (soon...) Many use cases will emerge. This tool will show you how close we are now, but not yet ready for the following use cases:

### Medical Education

1. **Visual Learning**:
   - Image generation tools can create detailed anatomical diagrams or pathological illustrations that enhance the visual learning experience for students.
   - They can generate images of rare conditions or presentations that may not be readily available in textbooks or online databases.

2. **Simulation and Training**:
   - Tools can simulate patient scenarios, including the progression of diseases, to help students understand the dynamic nature of human physiology and pathology.
   - They can be used to create virtual dissection labs or surgical simulations, providing an interactive learning environment without the need for cadavers or physical models.

3. **Customization for Curriculum**:
   - Educators can tailor images to specific teaching points or curricular needs, highlighting particular structures or pathologies relevant to the lesson.
   - They can generate images that correlate with specific patient cases or scenarios discussed in problem-based learning sessions.

4. **Accessibility and Diversity**:
   - Image generation can provide a diverse range of patient images, representing various ages, genders, and ethnicities, promoting inclusivity in medical education.
   - They can create images that are easily accessible to students for self-study or remote learning.

5. **Assessment and Testing**:
   - Tools can generate images for use in exams or quizzes, testing students' diagnostic skills or anatomical knowledge.
   - They can create novel clinical scenarios that require students to apply their knowledge in new and unfamiliar contexts.

### Clinical Care

1. **Patient Education and Communication**:
   - Clinicians can use image generation tools to create visual aids that help explain diagnoses, procedures, or treatment plans to patients.
   - They can generate images that are personalized to the patient's condition, improving understanding and adherence to treatment.

2. **Surgical Planning and Rehearsal**:
   - Surgeons can use generated images to plan complex procedures by visualizing anatomy and pathology in a three-dimensional context.
   - They can simulate different surgical approaches or techniques to determine the optimal strategy before actual surgery.

3. **Telemedicine**:
   - In telemedicine consultations, clinicians can use image generation to convey information to patients or to other healthcare providers when discussing cases.
   - Tools can also help generate anatomical models based on patient imaging data, facilitating remote diagnosis and treatment planning.

4. **Prosthesis and Implant Design**:
   - Custom images and models can be generated for the design of personalized prosthetics or implants, ensuring a better fit and function for individual patients.
   - They can also be used to visualize the integration of the implant with the patient's existing anatomy.

5. **Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy**:
   - Image generation tools can help create augmented images that highlight specific features or pathologies, assisting clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses.
   - They can be used to generate comparative images that demonstrate the progression of a disease or the response to treatment over time.

In both educational and clinical settings, the use of image generation tools must be guided by ethical considerations, ensuring that generated images are used appropriately and do not mislead or replace the need for actual patient data and consent where necessary. 
Furthermore, the quality and accuracy of the generated images must be validated to ensure they meet the high standards required for medical use.

interview_feedback = """**Review and Enhance Feedback for Medical Students on Simulated Residency Interviews**

As an educator tasked with providing feedback on simulated residency interviews for medical students, you are given a transcript of each student's interview performance. Your role is to analyze the transcript meticulously to deliver constructive and tailored feedback. Your feedback should include:

1. **Strengths Identification**: Highlight specific techniques, responses, or behaviors the student displayed during the interview that were effective and should be continued in future interviews. These could include excellent communication skills, appropriate professional demeanor, or accurate and thoughtful answers to interview questions.
   
2. **Areas for Improvement**: Recommend new strategies or approaches the student could incorporate to enhance their interview performance. This could involve suggestions for better handling stress, improving body language, or refining their answers to common residency interview questions.
   
3. **Avoidance Strategies**: Point out any missteps or inappropriate responses the student made during the simulated interview. Provide clear advice on how to avoid such pitfalls in future interviews, ensuring the student understands the potential negative impact of these actions on their candidacy.

Your feedback should be specific, actionable, and supportive, aimed at encouraging each student's growth and confidence in their interview skills. Be sure to personalize your feedback based on the individual characteristics of each student's performance to ensure relevance and effectiveness.
