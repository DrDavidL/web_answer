Here are some general steps for treating localized cellulitis:

1. **Oral Antibiotics**: For a healthy patient with localized cellulitis, oral antibiotics are usually the first line of treatment. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include cephalexin or dicloxacillin. If MRSA is suspected, doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used.

2. **Monitor the Patient**: It's important to monitor the patient's response to treatment. Improvement should be seen within a few days. If the cellulitis doesn't improve, the patient may need to be reevaluated and possibly switched to a different antibiotic.

3. **Supportive Care**: Encourage the patient to rest and elevate the affected area to help reduce swelling. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also be used to manage discomfort.

4. **Prevention**: Good skin hygiene can help prevent future episodes of cellulitis. This includes keeping the skin clean and moisturized, promptly treating any cuts or scrapes, and using a moisturizer to prevent skin cracking.

Remember, this is a general guideline and the treatment may vary based on the patient's specific condition and response to medication. Always consult with a healthcare professional for the most appropriate treatment."""

3. **Pneumonia:** Although less likely given the duration of symptoms and presence of a mass, a complicated pneumonia could potentially appear as a mass on a chest X-ray.
4. **Pulmonary Abscess:** Similar to pneumonia, an abscess could potentially appear as a mass, though this is less likely without other signs of acute infection.
5. **Fungal Infection:** Certain fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis or aspergillosis, can mimic cancer on imaging and cause chronic respiratory symptoms, particularly in certain geographic areas or with certain exposures.


*Lower Probability:*
1. **Sarcoidosis:** This is less common, but can cause similar symptoms and imaging findings.
2. **Lung Adenoma or Pulmonary Hamartoma:** These benign tumors could theoretically cause a mass, but are less likely and typically don't cause symptoms unless they're large.

2. Right Heart Failure: The symptoms of right heart failure such as peripheral edema, ascites, and jugular venous distention can mimic constrictive pericarditis.

3. Tricuspid Regurgitation: The backflow of blood into the right atrium due to valve dysfunction can cause symptoms that overlap with those of constrictive pericarditis.

4. Pericardial Effusion or Tamponade: Fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac can also mimic the symptoms of constrictive pericarditis.

5. Hepatic Cirrhosis: This can cause ascites and peripheral edema, symptoms that can resemble those of constrictive pericarditis.

6. Nephrotic Syndrome: Characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, nephrotic syndrome can cause systemic symptoms that may be mistaken for constrictive pericarditis.

7. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or Cor Pulmonale: These conditions can cause right-sided heart symptoms that can resemble those of constrictive pericarditis.

8. Pulmonary Hypertension: This condition increases pressure on the right side of the heart and can mimic symptoms of constrictive pericarditis.

9. Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome: This condition, often caused by a malignancy or thrombosis in the SVC, can present with symptoms similar to constrictive pericarditis.

10. Constrictive Bronchiolitis: Although primarily a pulmonary condition, severe cases can affect the cardiovascular system and mimic constrictive pericarditis.

Having diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure, being overweight, and heart disease means you have to be careful about what you eat. Here's a simple guide:

**Eat more fruits and veggies**: They are good for you. Try to eat them at every meal.
**Choose whole grains**: Foods like brown rice and whole wheat bread are better than white rice and white bread.
**Go for lean meats**: Try chicken, turkey, or fish more often than red meat.
**Eat less salt**: This helps with your blood pressure. Be careful with packaged foods, they often have a lot of salt.
**Drink water**: Instead of sugary drinks like soda or fruit juice, drink water.
**Watch your portions**: Even if a food is good for you, eating too much can make you gain weight.
What should I avoid?

**Avoid sugary foods**: Foods like candy, cookies, soda, and fruit juice can make your blood sugar go up too much.
**Avoid fatty foods**: Foods like fast food, fried food, and fatty meats can make heart disease worse.
**Avoid salty foods**: Things like chips, canned soups, and fast food can make your blood pressure go up.
**Avoid alcohol**: It can cause problems with your blood sugar and blood pressure.
Remember, everyone is different. What works for someone else might not work for you. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian to get help with your diet."""

pt_ed_intermediate_example = """What should I eat?

Managing diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and heart disease involves careful consideration of your diet. Here are some recommendations:

**Increase fruit and vegetable intake**: These are high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, but low in calories. Aim to include a variety of colors in your meals to ensure you're getting a wide range of nutrients.
Choose whole grains over refined grains: Whole grains like brown rice, whole grain bread, and quinoa have more fiber and help control blood sugar levels better than refined grains like white bread and white rice.
Opt for lean proteins: Choose lean meats like chicken or turkey, and fish which is high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Limit red meat, as it can be high in unhealthy fats.
Limit sodium (salt) intake: High sodium can raise blood pressure. Aim for no more than 2300 mg per day. Beware of hidden sodium in processed and restaurant foods.
Stay hydrated with water: Choose water or unsweetened drinks over soda or fruit juices, which can be high in sugar.
Monitor portion sizes: Even healthy foods can lead to weight gain if eaten in large amounts. Use measuring cups or a food scale to ensure you're not overeating.
What should I avoid?

**Limit sugary foods and drinks**: These can cause your blood sugar to spike and can lead to weight gain. This includes sweets like candy, cookies, and sugary beverages.
**Limit saturated and trans fats**: These types of fats are found in fried foods, fast foods, and fatty cuts of meat, and can increase your risk of heart disease.
**Avoid high-sodium foods**: Foods like chips, canned soups, and some fast foods can be high in sodium, which can raise your blood pressure.
**Moderate alcohol intake**: Alcohol can affect your blood sugar and blood pressure. Limit to no more than one drink per day for women and two for men.
Remember, individual dietary needs can vary. It's important to consult with a dietitian or your healthcare provider to create a personalized meal plan. Regular physical activity, medication adherence, and regular 
check-ups are also crucial for managing your conditions."""

pt_ed_advanced_example = """What should I eat?

Managing conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, obesity, and coronary artery disease requires careful dietary planning. Here are some specific recommendations:

**Increase fruit and vegetable intake**: Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, with low energy density. Aim for at least 5 servings per day, including a variety of colors to ensure a broad spectrum of nutrients.
**Choose whole grains over refined grains**: Whole grains contain the entire grain â€” the bran, germ, and endosperm. Foods made from these grains are rich in fiber, which can slow the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream and prevent spikes in glucose 
and insulin. Opt for brown rice, oatmeal, whole grain bread, and quinoa.
**Opt for lean proteins and plant-based proteins**: Select lean meats like skinless chicken or turkey, and fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and mackerel. Plant-based proteins, such as lentils, beans, and tofu, can also be good sources of protein 
and are beneficial for kidney disease management.
**Limit sodium (salt) intake**: Excessive sodium can contribute to hypertension and exacerbate kidney disease by causing more protein to be excreted in the urine. Aim for less than 2300 mg per day and consider even lower targets as advised by your healthcare provider. 
Remember that processed and restaurant foods often contain high levels of hidden sodium.
**Hydrate with water and limit sugary drinks**: Water should be your primary beverage. Sugary drinks, including fruit juices, can significantly increase your daily sugar and calorie intake.
**Monitor portion sizes**: Use portion control to avoid overeating and manage weight. This is critical even with healthy foods, as excess calories can lead to weight gain and worsen insulin resistance.
What should I avoid?

**Limit foods high in added sugars**: High sugar foods and drinks can cause hyperglycemia and contribute to obesity. Be aware of foods with hidden sugars like low-fat snacks or processed foods.
**Limit saturated and trans fats**: These types of fats, found in fried foods, fast foods, and fatty cuts of meat, can increase LDL ("bad") cholesterol and decrease HDL ("good") cholesterol, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis.
**Avoid high-sodium foods**: Excessive sodium can exacerbate hypertension and kidney disease. High-sodium foods often include processed foods, fast foods, and certain canned or packaged foods.
**Moderate alcohol intake**: Excessive alcohol can lead to hypertension, and in diabetics, it can cause hypoglycemia. If you do drink, limit yourself to up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.
Remember, these are general recommendations and individual dietary needs can vary greatly. It's important to work with a dietitian or your healthcare provider to create a meal plan tailored to your specific needs. Regular physical activity, medication adherence, regular

chain_of_density_summary_template = """**Instructions**:
- **Context**: Rely solely on the {context} given. Avoid referencing external sources.
- **Task**: Produce a series of summaries for the provided context, each fitting a word count of {word_count}. Each summary should be more entity-dense than the last.
- **Process** (Repeat 5 times):
  1. From the entire context, pinpoint 1-3 informative entities absent in the last summary. Separate these entities with ';'.
  2. Craft a summary of the same length that encompasses details from the prior summary and the newly identified entities.

**Entity Definition**:
- **Relevant**: Directly related to the main narrative.
- **Specific**: Descriptive but succinct (maximum of 5 words).
- **Novel**: Absent in the preceding summary.
- **Faithful**: Extracted from the context.
- **Location**: Can appear anywhere within the context.

**Guidelines**:
- Start with a general summary of the specified word count. It can be broad, using phrases like 'the context talks about'.
- Every word in the summary should impart meaningful information. Refine the prior summary for smoother flow and to integrate added entities.
- Maximize space by merging details, condensing information, and removing redundant phrases.
- Summaries should be compact, clear, and standalone, ensuring they can be understood without revisiting the context.
- You can position newly identified entities anywhere in the revised summary.
- Retain all entities from the prior summary. If space becomes an issue, introduce fewer new entities.
- Each summary iteration should maintain the designated word count.

2. **Ensure Clinical Relevance**: Questions should be grounded in clinical scenarios or real-world applications. 
3. **Avoid Ambiguity or Tricky Questions**: The wording should be clear and unambiguous. Avoid using negatives, especially double negatives. 
4. **Use Standardized Terminology**: Stick to universally accepted medical terminology. 
5. **Avoid "All of the Above" or "None of the Above"**
6. **Balance Between Recall and Application**: While some questions might test basic recall, strive to include questions that assess application, analysis, and synthesis of knowledge.
7. **Avoid Cultural or Gender Bias**: Ensure questions and scenarios are inclusive and don't inadvertently favor a particular group.
8. **Use Clear and Concise Language**: Avoid lengthy stems or vignettes unless necessary for the context. The complexity should come from the medical content, not the language.
9. **Make Plausible**: All options should be homogeneous and plausible to avoid cueing to the correct option. Distractors (incorrect options) are plausible but clearly incorrect upon careful reading.

Objective: To optimize the formatting of a multiple-choice question (MCQ) for clear display in a ChatGPT prompt.
Assumptions: You want the MCQ to be presented in a structured and readable manner for the ChatGPT model.

**Sample MCQ - Follow this format**:

**Question**:
What is the general structure of recommendations for treating Rheumatoid Arthritis according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)?

**Options**:
- **A.** Single algorithm with 3 treatment phases irrespective of disease duration
- **B.** Distinction between early (â‰¤6 months) and established RA with separate algorithm for each
- **C.** Treat-to-target strategy with aim at reducing disease activity by â‰¥50%
- **D.** Initial therapy with Methotrexate monotherapy with or without addition of glucocorticoids


The correct answer is **B. Distinction between early (â‰¤6 months) and established RA with separate algorithm for each**.

**Rationale**:

1. The ACR guidelines for RA treatment make a clear distinction between early RA (disease duration â‰¤6 months) and established RA (disease duration >6 months). The rationale behind this distinction is the recognition that early RA and established RA may have different prognostic implications and can respond differently to treatments. 
   
2. **A** is incorrect because while there are various treatment phases described by ACR, they don't universally follow a single algorithm irrespective of disease duration.

3. **C** may reflect an overarching goal in the management of many chronic diseases including RA, which is to reduce disease activity and improve the patient's quality of life. However, the specific quantification of "â‰¥50%" isn't a standard adopted universally by the ACR for RA.

4. **D** does describe an initial approach for many RA patients. Methotrexate is often the first-line drug of choice, and glucocorticoids can be added for additional relief, especially in the early phase of the disease to reduce inflammation. But, this option does not capture the overall structure of ACR's recommendations for RA.

Patient: Anonymous

Date: [Insert Date]

Chief Complaint: Patient presents with persistent, non-specific abdominal discomfort for the past two weeks.

History of Present Illness: The patient, a 59-year-old male, reports a dull, constant ache in the lower abdomen. He denies any associated symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. The patient, who has a history of stress-related disorders, has not noticed any recent changes in diet or lifestyle that could explain the discomfort.

Physical Examination: Abdomen is soft, non-distended with mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are normoactive. Rest of the examination is unremarkable.

Assessment: Non-specific abdominal pain. Given the patient's age and history, the differential diagnoses lean towards conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or gastritis, which can be exacerbated by stress. However, other possibilities such as peptic ulcer disease and diverticulitis are also considered.

Plan: Recommend further diagnostic evaluation with abdominal ultrasound and upper GI endoscopy. Advise the patient to maintain a food diary to identify potential dietary triggers and consider stress management techniques as part of a holistic approach to his health.
