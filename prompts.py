sample_question = "How should I treat localized cellulitis in an otherwise normal patient?"
sample_response = """Localized cellulitis in an otherwise healthy patient is typically treated with antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic can depend on the suspected causative organism, usually Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.

Here are some general steps for treating localized cellulitis:

1. **Oral Antibiotics**: For a healthy patient with localized cellulitis, oral antibiotics are usually the first line of treatment. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include cephalexin or dicloxacillin. If MRSA is suspected, doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used.

2. **Monitor the Patient**: It's important to monitor the patient's response to treatment. Improvement should be seen within a few days. If the cellulitis doesn't improve, the patient may need to be reevaluated and possibly switched to a different antibiotic.

3. **Supportive Care**: Encourage the patient to rest and elevate the affected area to help reduce swelling. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also be used to manage discomfort.

4. **Prevention**: Good skin hygiene can help prevent future episodes of cellulitis. This includes keeping the skin clean and moisturized, promptly treating any cuts or scrapes, and using a moisturizer to prevent skin cracking.

Remember, this is a general guideline and the treatment may vary based on the patient's specific condition and response to medication. Always consult with a healthcare professional for the most appropriate treatment."""
