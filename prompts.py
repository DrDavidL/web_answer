sample_question = "How should I treat localized cellulitis in an otherwise normal patient?"
sample_response = """Localized cellulitis in an otherwise healthy patient is typically treated with antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic can depend on the suspected causative organism, usually Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.

Here are some general steps for treating localized cellulitis:

1. **Oral Antibiotics**: For a healthy patient with localized cellulitis, oral antibiotics are usually the first line of treatment. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include cephalexin or dicloxacillin. If MRSA is suspected, doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used.

2. **Monitor the Patient**: It's important to monitor the patient's response to treatment. Improvement should be seen within a few days. If the cellulitis doesn't improve, the patient may need to be reevaluated and possibly switched to a different antibiotic.

3. **Supportive Care**: Encourage the patient to rest and elevate the affected area to help reduce swelling. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also be used to manage discomfort.

4. **Prevention**: Good skin hygiene can help prevent future episodes of cellulitis. This includes keeping the skin clean and moisturized, promptly treating any cuts or scrapes, and using a moisturizer to prevent skin cracking.

Remember, this is a general guideline and the treatment may vary based on the patient's specific condition and response to medication. Always consult with a healthcare professional for the most appropriate treatment."""

*Moderate Probability:*
1. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** The patient's history of smoking also makes COPD a potential diagnosis, but this wouldn't typically cause a mass on the chest X-ray.
2. **Tuberculosis (TB):** If the patient has been exposed to TB, this could explain his symptoms and the mass, particularly if the mass is a result of a Ghon complex or calcified granuloma.
3. **Pneumonia:** Although less likely given the duration of symptoms and presence of a mass, a complicated pneumonia could potentially appear as a mass on a chest X-ray.
4. **Pulmonary Abscess:** Similar to pneumonia, an abscess could potentially appear as a mass, though this is less likely without other signs of acute infection.
5. **Fungal Infection:** Certain fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis or aspergillosis, can mimic cancer on imaging and cause chronic respiratory symptoms, particularly in certain geographic areas or with certain exposures.


*Lower Probability:*
1. **Sarcoidosis:** This is less common, but can cause similar symptoms and imaging findings.
2. **Lung Adenoma or Pulmonary Hamartoma:** These benign tumors could theoretically cause a mass, but are less likely and typically don't cause symptoms unless they're large.
3. **Silicosis:** Given the patient's occupational exposure, this could be a consideration, but typically causes a more diffuse process rather than a single mass.

The following is a list of some alternative diagnoses a clinician might consider if initially suspecting constrictive pericarditis:

1. Restrictive Cardiomyopathy: Similar to constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy can cause reduced filling of the ventricles and can result in similar signs and symptoms.

2. Right Heart Failure: The symptoms of right heart failure such as peripheral edema, ascites, and jugular venous distention can mimic constrictive pericarditis.

3. Tricuspid Regurgitation: The backflow of blood into the right atrium due to valve dysfunction can cause symptoms that overlap with those of constrictive pericarditis.

4. Pericardial Effusion or Tamponade: Fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac can also mimic the symptoms of constrictive pericarditis.

5. Hepatic Cirrhosis: This can cause ascites and peripheral edema, symptoms that can resemble those of constrictive pericarditis.

6. Nephrotic Syndrome: Characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, nephrotic syndrome can cause systemic symptoms that may be mistaken for constrictive pericarditis.

7. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or Cor Pulmonale: These conditions can cause right-sided heart symptoms that can resemble those of constrictive pericarditis.

8. Pulmonary Hypertension: This condition increases pressure on the right side of the heart and can mimic symptoms of constrictive pericarditis.

9. Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome: This condition, often caused by a malignancy or thrombosis in the SVC, can present with symptoms similar to constrictive pericarditis.

10. Constrictive Bronchiolitis: Although primarily a pulmonary condition, severe cases can affect the cardiovascular system and mimic constrictive pericarditis.

Having diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure, being overweight, and heart disease means you have to be careful about what you eat. Here's a simple guide:

**Eat more fruits and veggies**: They are good for you. Try to eat them at every meal.
**Choose whole grains**: Foods like brown rice and whole wheat bread are better than white rice and white bread.
**Go for lean meats**: Try chicken, turkey, or fish more often than red meat.
**Eat less salt**: This helps with your blood pressure. Be careful with packaged foods, they often have a lot of salt.
**Drink water**: Instead of sugary drinks like soda or fruit juice, drink water.
**Watch your portions**: Even if a food is good for you, eating too much can make you gain weight.
What should I avoid?

**Avoid sugary foods**: Foods like candy, cookies, soda, and fruit juice can make your blood sugar go up too much.
**Avoid fatty foods**: Foods like fast food, fried food, and fatty meats can make heart disease worse.
**Avoid salty foods**: Things like chips, canned soups, and fast food can make your blood pressure go up.
**Avoid alcohol**: It can cause problems with your blood sugar and blood pressure.
Remember, everyone is different. What works for someone else might not work for you. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian to get help with your diet."""

pt_ed_intermediate_example = """What should I eat?

Managing diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and heart disease involves careful consideration of your diet. Here are some recommendations:

**Increase fruit and vegetable intake**: These are high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, but low in calories. Aim to include a variety of colors in your meals to ensure you're getting a wide range of nutrients.
Choose whole grains over refined grains: Whole grains like brown rice, whole grain bread, and quinoa have more fiber and help control blood sugar levels better than refined grains like white bread and white rice.
Opt for lean proteins: Choose lean meats like chicken or turkey, and fish which is high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Limit red meat, as it can be high in unhealthy fats.
Limit sodium (salt) intake: High sodium can raise blood pressure. Aim for no more than 2300 mg per day. Beware of hidden sodium in processed and restaurant foods.
Stay hydrated with water: Choose water or unsweetened drinks over soda or fruit juices, which can be high in sugar.
Monitor portion sizes: Even healthy foods can lead to weight gain if eaten in large amounts. Use measuring cups or a food scale to ensure you're not overeating.
What should I avoid?

**Limit sugary foods and drinks**: These can cause your blood sugar to spike and can lead to weight gain. This includes sweets like candy, cookies, and sugary beverages.
**Limit saturated and trans fats**: These types of fats are found in fried foods, fast foods, and fatty cuts of meat, and can increase your risk of heart disease.
**Avoid high-sodium foods**: Foods like chips, canned soups, and some fast foods can be high in sodium, which can raise your blood pressure.
**Moderate alcohol intake**: Alcohol can affect your blood sugar and blood pressure. Limit to no more than one drink per day for women and two for men.
Remember, individual dietary needs can vary. It's important to consult with a dietitian or your healthcare provider to create a personalized meal plan. Regular physical activity, medication adherence, and regular 
check-ups are also crucial for managing your conditions."""

pt_ed_advanced_example = """What should I eat?

Managing conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, obesity, and coronary artery disease requires careful dietary planning. Here are some specific recommendations:

**Increase fruit and vegetable intake**: Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, with low energy density. Aim for at least 5 servings per day, including a variety of colors to ensure a broad spectrum of nutrients.
**Choose whole grains over refined grains**: Whole grains contain the entire grain â€” the bran, germ, and endosperm. Foods made from these grains are rich in fiber, which can slow the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream and prevent spikes in glucose 
and insulin. Opt for brown rice, oatmeal, whole grain bread, and quinoa.
**Opt for lean proteins and plant-based proteins**: Select lean meats like skinless chicken or turkey, and fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and mackerel. Plant-based proteins, such as lentils, beans, and tofu, can also be good sources of protein 
and are beneficial for kidney disease management.
**Limit sodium (salt) intake**: Excessive sodium can contribute to hypertension and exacerbate kidney disease by causing more protein to be excreted in the urine. Aim for less than 2300 mg per day and consider even lower targets as advised by your healthcare provider. 
Remember that processed and restaurant foods often contain high levels of hidden sodium.
**Hydrate with water and limit sugary drinks**: Water should be your primary beverage. Sugary drinks, including fruit juices, can significantly increase your daily sugar and calorie intake.
**Monitor portion sizes**: Use portion control to avoid overeating and manage weight. This is critical even with healthy foods, as excess calories can lead to weight gain and worsen insulin resistance.
What should I avoid?

**Limit foods high in added sugars**: High sugar foods and drinks can cause hyperglycemia and contribute to obesity. Be aware of foods with hidden sugars like low-fat snacks or processed foods.
**Limit saturated and trans fats**: These types of fats, found in fried foods, fast foods, and fatty cuts of meat, can increase LDL ("bad") cholesterol and decrease HDL ("good") cholesterol, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis.
**Avoid high-sodium foods**: Excessive sodium can exacerbate hypertension and kidney disease. High-sodium foods often include processed foods, fast foods, and certain canned or packaged foods.
**Moderate alcohol intake**: Excessive alcohol can lead to hypertension, and in diabetics, it can cause hypoglycemia. If you do drink, limit yourself to up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.
Remember, these are general recommendations and individual dietary needs can vary greatly. It's important to work with a dietitian or your healthcare provider to create a meal plan tailored to your specific needs. Regular physical activity, medication adherence, regular
